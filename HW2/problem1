# echo command prints a line of text written after it
echo GoHuskies

# the former command puts the text 'GoHuskies' in the file GoHuskies and then
# the latter command prints the text inside the file GoHuskies
echo GoHuskies > GoHuskies
cat GoHuskies

# ls 'filename' prints the file name if it exists
ls GoHuskies

# we alrady saved the word 'GoHuskies' in the file GoHuskies
# grep command is finding the pattern 'GoHuskies' in the file GoHuskies and then prints it
grep 'GoHuskies' GoHuskies

# created an alias named GoHuskies which prints out nothing and then called the alias
# used !! to repeat the previous command (first it prints the command and then its output
alias GoHuskies=''
